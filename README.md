# Skybrud.LinkPicker

Skybrud.LinkPicker is a small package that adds a single property editor to Umbraco 7 that can be used as either a single link picker or as a multi link picker depending on configuration.

Besides working like most other link pickers, it can also be configured to show a detailed list of the selected links (eg. as the table in the screenshot below).
